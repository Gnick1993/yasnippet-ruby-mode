# Snippets for Ruby Mode

## About

Comprehensive collection of Ruby snippets for
[yasnippet](http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/ "yasnippet - Google Code"). Some
snippets might not work correctly (yet), since they were originally
automatically converted from the TextMate repository. This is a work in
progress.

Note that some of the snippets are changed from how they are defined in the
official Yasnippet distribution, with a preference towards how they are defined
in TextMate. E.g., the reject snippet is here triggered with 'rej' instead of
'reject'.

The RSpec snippets require that RSpec files are edited in a separate
Emacs mode. I recommend using
[rspec-mode.el](http://github.com/Chrononaut/rspec-mode.el/tree/master).
The RSpec snippets were originally borrowed from
[gary/yasnippets-rspec](http://github.com/gary/yasnippets-rspec/tree/master).
